# Google Play Music play counter

Some months ago Google dropped the Google Play Music service, but allowed users to download their takeout file. This includes the actual music files, and a bunch of CSV files with song metadata (such as song title, artist, rating, play count etc).

The problem with this takeout file is that it generates _separate_ CSV files for each track, such as this:

```
Title,Album,Artist,Duration (ms),Rating,Play Count,Removed,Playlist Index
"Instant Crush (feat. Julian Casablancas)","Random Access Memories","Daft Punk","337525","0","79","","40"
```

This makes it difficult to see global statistics for your music collection, in case you care to do so. I was curious to see which songs I was listening the most back when I was using Google Play Music, so I created this script simply to loop over all the individual CSV files and prepare an ordered list of your tracks, sorted by number of play counts.

## Example output
```
[1] 79 - Instant Crush (feat. Julian Casablancas), Daft Punk [Random Access Memories]
[2] 35 - Get Lucky (feat. Pharrell Williams), Daft Punk [Random Access Memories]

[7] 19 - All Alone On Christmas, Darlene Love [Underground Garage Presents: Christmas a Go-Go]
